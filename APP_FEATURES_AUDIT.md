# OneCrew App Features Audit & Implementation Plan
## Library Update: onecrew-api-client v2.0.0 → v2.1.0

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** Library Updated ✓

---

## 1. Library Update Summary

### Completed Actions
- ✅ Updated `package.json` from `^2.0.0` to `^2.1.0`
- ✅ Installed new version
- ✅ Fixed pagination access patterns (`response.data.pagination` instead of `response.pagination`)
- ✅ Updated type definitions comment from v1.5.0 to v2.1.0
- ✅ Verified API method compatibility

### Breaking Changes Found
- **Pagination Structure**: API returns `ApiResponse<PaginatedResponse<T>>`, requiring `response.data?.pagination` access
